## About The Project

This project aims to revolutionize user interaction with computers by implementing a virtual mouse controlled entirely through hand gestures. Leveraging the power of computer vision techniques provided by libraries like MediaPipe and OpenCV, it tracks the user's hand movements in real-time, overlaying landmarks to accurately interpret gestures. By simply moving their index finger, users can effortlessly control the mouse cursor on their screen. Additionally, a click action is triggered by bringing the thumb close to the index finger, mimicking a mouse click gesture. The system is designed to be adaptable to various screen resolutions, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. With this innovative solution, users can navigate their digital world with intuitive hand gestures, enhancing both accessibility and convenience in computer interaction.
